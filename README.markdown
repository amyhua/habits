## Habit Tracker

This app is meant to be a personal diary,... with a flair for data analysis. Imagine being able to write your own journal entries and then have your journal automatically analyze your habits, moods, trends, analytics, etc. for you after you are done composing your post. The more you write, the better it gets.

### Design

#### Initial Stages

####1. Basic blog

The basic blog will feature blog posts, in reverse chronological order, with a sidebar of month/year timestamps for sorting and organization.

####2. Post Management

CRUD capabilities for posts. Implement "Read More" feature.

####3. Basic Histories

In addition to reflective journal entries, allow for the ability to log history of different activities, milestones, etc. thoughts and processes and activities accomplished for the day. Only works on a day by day basis. If you forget to log a certain day, that's too bad for you.
